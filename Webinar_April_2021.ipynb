    "- The GDC Application Programming Interface (API) is the external facing REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface for the GDC, which supports user interactions with the GDC Submission and Data Portals, as well as provides developers with a programmatic interface to query and download GDC data, metadata and annotations and submit data to the GDC.\n",
    "- The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST and DELETE)\n",
